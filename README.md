# WAP_GP9_PROJECT
This is a Web Application Programming course project that was done by Edwin Bwambale, Amanuel Kahsay and Faheem Humaira.  We were required to work in a group of three to accomplish the project using web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, JSPs and Ajax are technologies we had learn during the course.  The project was about fetching twitter feeds and trends from the twitter api. In this project we used twitter4j api to handle calls to the twitter api.  We use MVC architecture and the Model 2 architecture which is aimed at separating the Presentation (UI) from controller (request and response handling) and Model (the business login).
